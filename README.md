## A team project for CSC 648-848 Summer 2016

**GatorSwap** - a buy and sell website exclusive to San Francisco State University (SFSU) students. Emphasizing on simple design and easy navigation, GatorSwap is dedicated to giving SFSU students easy access to items that they need. We offer a wide variety of books, office supplies,  electronics, clothing, furniture and other items.

### Easy and more convenient!
Our collection of items come directly from SFSU students. This is what makes GatorSwap special. You spend less time searching for your items online because there is a big possibility that we have it.

### Registering is easy!
We just need your SFSU email, SFSU ID and your contact information and you are on your way to finding items, buying items, and selling your own items on GatorSwap.

With GatorSwap, you can start networking with people within your major or those who share the same interests as you!
